## RSA VHDL Term Project
A term project in 2020 where we implemented a montgomery algorithm for RSA encryption in VHDL for a PYNQ FPGA. We used montgomery multiplication with an RL-exponentiation, and a radix 4. 
The goal of the project was to optimize the design for performance. Using 5 cores, we were able to achieve the best result at NTNU from the past 2 years.
The keys are of 256 bit size.

The development used both a high level model developed in python and testbenches created in VHDL.
